Hey y'all, this is Dinesh. I am mostly active on Twitter and [this](https://twitter.com/ladidinesh) is my profile. 

I work at Walmart Global Tech, India as a Data Scientist and I write about SQL/ML/NLP in this blog. Its mostly code snippets / tricks that I have learnt over time. Some of them might be useful for you.
